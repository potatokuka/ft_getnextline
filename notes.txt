store if I have read from the current fd before, set to one at start, if (read.has)
then start reading, then set it read.has = 0; 




Read the file with READ until the next line,
save a pointer at the address of the start of the next
line.

Copy the GET string into a "to print string", this will be from the
start of the GET(POINTER)(START POINTER WILL BE CALLED TMP)
from this point until the (pointer) at the '/n', move this
GET(pointer) to the start of the next string, the [+1]
of get, set this new point to TMP, and iterate through this
until the GET(POINTER) reaches another '/n'

use strchr to find '/n'

use strjoin to concatonate the two strings together 






strlccpy
strlen(BUT ONLY TO INT C, which is a '\n')
strchr
use a strucct to refrence if the FD has been read yet with a read.has and a read.fd
